# stravaPicture
This is designed to be a standalone application that renders an HTML file that visualizes runs based on data taken from the strava api. To run the app get a valid Strava Token of the runner you want to follow by going on the Strava Developer page. Once you have this token save it to token.txt. Then you can render the map using python run.py
